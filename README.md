Hello, and welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Aleksander, and I'm a <b>FullStack Engineer</b> with over six years of experience in the industry. In addition to my web development expertise, I also have three years of experience in blockchain development. I specialize in using <b>Rust</b> for <b>blockchain development</b> and <b>Solidity</b> for writing <b>smart contracts</b>.<br>

Throughout my career, I've had the pleasure of working with a variety of companies, from big government organizations to innovative startups. I pride myself on my ability to write scalable applications and to thoroughly test them before deployment.

I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and methodologies in the field, and I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my GitHub page, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to work together on a project.
